# Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-
Here are some different projects I've worked on with NLP techniques in Python. I've used a variety of packages and techniques. The techniques used in each notebook are listed in the first cell.

The .csv files needed for each .ipnyb are located as links to kaggle at a text cell at the top of the notebook.

Please run on Google Colab. Jupyter notebook does not run many of the packages as well. I suggest getting a Google Colab account ($10/month) and change runtime to "TPU" or "GPU" with 'high RAM' setting on to significantly speed up the process. This is something you cannot do in Jupyter Notebook.
