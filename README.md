# Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-
Here are some different projects I've worked on with NLP techniques in Python. I've used a variety of packages and techniques. Some techniques are bigrams, LDA, tokenization, BERT (google model), 

The .csv files needed for each .ipnyb are located as links to kaggle at a text cell at the top of the notebook.

Please run on Google Colab! Jupyter notebook does not run as well. I suggest getting a Google Colab account ($10/month) and change runtime to "TPU" or "GPU" with high RAM setting on.
